# Identical to fsi_2d_bdf2_uncoupled.prm, but here the no-slip boundary
# condition is enforced weakly with a Lagrange multiplier.
#
# Velocity MMS is set to the time derivative of the mesh movement,
# and is constant in space. This is because enforcing a velocity different
# from the mesh velocity on the weak boundaries requries modifying the assembled
# equation or adding a source term for lambda.
#
# Pressure MMS is arbitrary.
